# Smart-Mini-Calculator-
A responsive, browser-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations and offers a smooth, user-friendly interface designed for quick calculations.

##  Objective
The goal was to build a clean and functional mini calculator that allows users to:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
- Use decimal values
- Reset or clear calculations
- Handle multiple operations with correct operator precedence

##  Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structuring the calculator layout
- **CSS** – Styling the buttons, layout, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** – Handling all logic and calculations

##  Features
- Performs real-time arithmetic calculations
- Supports decimal input and chained operations
- Clear (`C`) and Delete (`⌫`) buttons for quick editing
- Operator precedence handling using `eval()` or custom logic
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
  
##  Future Improvements
- Add scientific functions (square root, percentage, etc.)
- Show history of calculations
- Add dark mode and/or voice input

##  Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand:
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- How user inputs are processed logically
- The structure and flow of building responsive web tools
